    const dataset = "creator mate is a dutch started founded by jens glerum & marnix vandooren. these two have been working together for the past 4 years, founded multiple creator focused business such as creator talent agency, creator partnership agency, and as individuals working with creators they were close to such as Ben Azelart, Anotr, Cordea, Tommyswereld.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "creator mate started when both co-founders discovered that as a creator you need juggle way to many roles at once if you want to experience any form of success. for example, as a creator who is starting, you are the director, editor, writer, videographer, bookkeeper, sales person, and much much more. this is not even considering what it takes to succeed as a creator, because building an audience online and turning this into a community is really hard, especially when you are the brains and the face.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "we had the opportunity to work closely with creators for the past few years, and see what it does when others help them achieve their goals. knowing that this isn‚Äôt scaleable (meaning we can‚Äôt help millions of creators at once) we started exploring other options. during this period AI became more trustworthy, and reliable. we started discovering and documenting what it is we actually do as ‚Äúcreator consultants‚Äù and found out that most of our job is analysing what sticks with your audience and how we can enhance this to create a meaningful connection, and a community people want to be a part off. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "we took the time to create, test, analyse, and optimise multiple AI models. Seeking for one who helped creators best, considering that we need to enhance & stimulate their creativity instead of trying to replace it, help them learn and understand what we found within their data (relationship with audience) make sure they know best what it is they‚Äôre audience wants to see, and just helping on the side making sure this is also what is being created and distributed. and of course many more things that will help creators build, grow & monetise their community.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "yes, monetisation! Probably not in the way you think of right now ‚Äì we want creators to suggest to their audience instead of sell to their audience, and find ways for brands and creators to collaborate in this way. BUT we also believe that creators should focus on creating digital equity in their own products, services, content, etc. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "we want to help people make of living by doing what they love.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "if we can help creators by sharing insights from their profile, defining what it is their audience actually would want, and in what way we can do this while also making sure we can put bread on the table ‚Äì it would be insane.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "so how do we think you grow as a creator? what is our philosophy? \n" +
        "\n" +
        "after working with many creators and testing first hand strategies that enabled qualitative growth these were the best self tested strategies!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "So this is actually how the platforms work (instagram) \n" +
        "instagram ranks each profile (from creators and consumers) in categories, from niches (interest) to value (activity & consumebility) once your profile has a high value and your niche is clear to instagram, your content will be tested to an audience similar to those who currently engage most with your profile, but also user groups similar to the profiles you engage most with.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "meaning that if you are a personal trainer posting content online about your training schedule and body transformations, make sure to engage with accounts who could be interested, these can best be found when looking for profiles who are successful (high engagement rate) and engaging with their audiences.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "then when you publish content it is shown/ tested to those accounts you think are interested. THEN we can finally analyse and optimise your content! Because most accounts (if they even analyse) analyse & optimise their content for the wrong audience.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "So now that we know the audience our latest posts are suggested to we can check in analytics how they are responding, matrics that we care about are:\n" +
        "reach\n" +
        "engagement\n" +
        "saves\n" +
        "likes\n" +
        "shares\n" +
        "profile clicks\n" +
        "profile clicks into new followers\n" +
        "story views from non follower accounts\n" +
        "closed story\n" +
        "watched back\n" +
        "retention rate\n" +
        "\n" +
        "these insights will help us gain understanding of what really interest our audience, but only once we know the concept of the post is clear, is related to one specific topic and allows us to get some insight in the audience interest.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "then we can color in this data, analyse what really interest your audience, and how we can implement these learnings into our new posts.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "these insights in what interest our audience in the form of:\n" +
        "the topic of the content\n" +
        "the format of the content\n" +
        "the way audiences can engage with the content\n" +
        "what the audience does after consuming the content\n" +
        "what happens to new viewers consuming the content?\n" +
        "what happens to followers consuming the content?\n" +
        "\n" +
        "when we discover this we can really help creators in many ways, from growing your audience, partnering with brands, partnering with other relevant creators to your community, launching own products, and services, etc. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "so creator mate is using all this knowledge is trained to contextualise and categorise data, to help you build, grow & monetise your audience. from explaining its findings, to taking tasks of your to-do list, helping with engagement, and so much more.\n" +

        "\n" +
        "our goal is to grow this community to +10K content creators with the ambition to become a full-time creator. if we are able to achieve this we will raise a second round of investment of around a million dollars to speed up the process, by hiring more talented individuals who understand and resonate with our mission. we also believe that with this money we have the ability and job to show what the creator economy really stands for, showing that the number on your profile are truly real people by hosting irl events for creators and their community. \n" +

        "we are also working on doing brand partnership programs where we manually select brands who we feel like understand the true value of working with content creators (not ugc creators) and stimulate partnerships between creators and brands, where creators are being suggested to a brand based on their content style, audience interest, personal interest, fit with the brand, brand community, brand status, etc. we also believe that a partnership should last a period of time where the creator can really offer something special to their audience, and the brand can leverage from working with existing communities, meaning our AI model will help brainstorm ways to collaborate, what pricing method we would suggest based on both data points we know, and ofcourse for what period of time you should work and after what metrics you should consider long term partnerships.\n" +
